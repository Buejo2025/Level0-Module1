# Goal: Write a Python program that asks the user for the radius 
#       of a circle and displays the area of that circle.
#       The formula for the area of a circle is πr^2.
#       See example image in package to check your output.

    # Move your turtle to a new x,y position using .goto()
    background45.goto()
    # Calculate the area of your circle and store it in a variable
    # Hint, you can use math.pi

    # Write the area of your circle using the turtle .write() method
